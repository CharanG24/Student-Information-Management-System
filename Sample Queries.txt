Generate Grade Report for a Student

SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, c.course_name, e.grade
FROM Enrollments e
JOIN Students s ON e.student_id = s.student_id
JOIN Courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
WHERE s.student_id = 1;


Track Student Progress (Average Grade per Course):

SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, c.course_name, AVG(CASE 
            WHEN e.grade = 'A' THEN 4
            WHEN e.grade = 'B' THEN 3
            WHEN e.grade = 'C' THEN 2
            WHEN e.grade = 'D' THEN 1
            ELSE 0
        END) AS average_grade
FROM Enrollments e
JOIN Students s ON e.student_id = s.student_id
JOIN Courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
GROUP BY s.student_id, c.course_name;


Analyze Enrollment Trends (Most Popular Courses):

SELECT c.course_name, COUNT(e.enrollment_id) AS num_enrollments
FROM Enrollments e
JOIN Courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
GROUP BY c.course_name
ORDER BY num_enrollments DESC;
